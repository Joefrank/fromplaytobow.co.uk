The LSO number is 7 now

Could you please remove my home address from the contacts and replace it with the email address instead and my phone number. I would keep my home address for the document only, so I have control who gets hold of it.

Could you please put under the Musicianship tab either separately Where it is or add to the Fee tab the Venue as well, like FEES AND VENUE and use the Vibast address - Musicianship classes are held at Vibast Community Centre 163 Old Street, The City London, EC1V 9NG.

The Exams and Auditions has past recitals on it, if you could remove them

Could you please put the Piano time table that I sent you under the classes tab

I will email you the links to youtube over the weekend, I only have 2, but it's a start.

Please confirm with me your bank details, I think the last payment I made to you was around Easter holiday,




HI Joe,

I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday, I had a very packed day.
I've attached the piano time-table
my address for the document is 73 Grayson House, Radnor Street, London EC1V 3SS
the address for the musicianship is Vibast Community Centre 163 Old Street, The City
London, EC1V 9NG
Regarding the audios - I've decided to follow your advice and use youtube links. Yesterday I had a child playing videoed and the quality is excellent.
If you could give me till the end of this week I will send you few links.

Kind regards,
Ina
